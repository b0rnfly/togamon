# omfg
*before anything in this post, know that i am stuck at a picnic area dying bc I have to pee*
------

# so,
__today started off fucking crazzzzy__ like literally insane.
Marcos has an older brother thats an addict, now Marcos mom *__someone we have always helped__* started being fucking shady bc she couldnt have her way, lmao. 
## I digress
so she he comes to the house at 6 am crawling thru windows etc. so you already know i opened my big ass moutj and let it be known *that, that is a fuckin' dead thing* anyway nothing more than a lesson to me tbh, *dont help selfish ass people* __which i know we all say all the time__
### The car, 
took so much of the morning, you see we decided to leave Monday instead of Friday cuz we are so ready to go and experience our new life in Portland. 
so this meant getting all of the cars things __the day we leave__ so it went a lil like this:
>*2 hours at stop number one for tires and oil
*40 mins to get a new windshield [for 150, its brand fuckin new]
*1 hour stranger fixing my headlight & car lighter
